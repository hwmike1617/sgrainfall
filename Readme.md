### Problem Statement
Singapore imports 42% of its fruits and vegetables from Malaysia. With the recent closure of the borders between Singapore and Malaysia, and together with the recent price hike in vegetables being sold in Malaysia (https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cna-explains-where-does-singapore-get-its-food-2709161), Singapore government is finding ways to increase its own local vegetable production to be more self-reliant.
The **Air Temperature And Sunshine, Relative Humidity And Rainfall Monthly** data provided by the Department of Statistics (https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M890081) will enable local vegetable famers or agricultural farms to better plan for the growth and harvesting of their vegetables produce.
